## Features ‚ú®  

- **GPG Encryption**: Encrypt and decrypt files securely with GPG.  
- **Blackbox Integration**: Simplifies managing encrypted files in Git repositories.  
- **Test Environment**: Designed for learning and testing Blackbox functionality.  

---

## Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è  

- GPG installed on your system.  
- Blackbox installed ([Blackbox GitHub](https://github.com/StackExchange/blackbox)).
